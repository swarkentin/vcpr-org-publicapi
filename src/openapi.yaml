        This endpoint authenticates a User from an `identifier` (normally an
        email address) and `password`. It also identifies the application making
        requests from the `apikey`. The response returns the User object for the
        logged-in User and a token for use in future secured requests, as well
        as a `fileSignature` and `filePolicy` which may be used for access to
        images stored on FileStack.
